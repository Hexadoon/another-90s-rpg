# Another 90's RPG

## Concept Statement

A turn based RPG with action commands similar to games like Bug Fables and SMRPG, and a storytelling style and level of seriousNess similar to that of Earthbound. Four characters who live in the same hometown and somewhat know each other to varying degrees reluctantly band together to go on an adventure prompted by a unifying event that turns their natural skills into abilities capable of beating monsters. 

Ted. Baseball player, a kind hearted tank who is no slouch on offense.
Sam. TCG playing kid, smart spellcaster who has a quick wit to match.
Rose. Thinks she’s a ninja, good at debuffs and attacking enemy weaknesses.
Madeline. Med student, obligatory cleric who has a “unique” style of healing.

A convenient sudden rise in monster activities leads the group outside of the safety of their town to try out their newly gained strength, where a mysterious guide helps them learn what they can do. Eventually the group will learn that the fortuitous timing of events is not coincidental. An RPG ensues. Enemies get bashed, shops get visited, inns get patronized, and, who knows, a few Gods might get killed. Such is the life of an RPG hero squad.
